	 * We could use focus-within, but it would only help
	 * moving the label up. Next we need to move it back
	 * when the focus is lost, but only if there is not
	 * entered text. To achieve this, we use a trick with
	 * the placeholder. The placeholder is always set to
	 * " " (a space), and we use the :placeholder-shown
	 * pseudo-class to detect when the placeholder is
	 * shown. When it is not shown, we move the label
	 * back down.
	 * Therefore, instead of using focus-within on the label
	 * itself, we use +label on the input. It also means
	 * that in the DOM, the label must be placed after the
	 * input.
